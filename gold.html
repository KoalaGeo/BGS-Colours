<h1>Mine production of gold for WMP 2014-18<a class="headerlink" href="#mine-production-of-gold-for-wmp-2014-18" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In addition to ‘industrial scale’ gold mines around the world, a significant quantity of gold is mined by small scale or artisanal producers, both on a legal and illegal basis. In some countries the quantities involved with artisanal mining can be relatively large. The compilation of reliable data for the quantity produced by artisanal mining in each country is difficult, particularly where the actions are illegal. Artisanal mining can be seasonal, temporary and highly variable, on both geographical and temporal scales.</p>
<p>Where possible, the table attempts to include estimates for artisanal mining of gold in order that the calculated world totals are as complete as possible. However, the difficulties noted above mean that these totals cannot be completely accurate and they are consequently rounded to a greater degree than the individual country figures may suggest is appropriate. This is an attempt to convey the level of uncertainty associated with these total figures.</p>
<p>For clarity, additional comments on specific countries are shown below (there may be other countries where artisanal mining also occurs; these comments are not intended to be exhaustive):-</p>
<div class="section" id="benin">
<h2>Benin<a class="headerlink" href="#benin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Artisanal gold mining is known to take place but no reliable estimates are available. It has been estimated to be in the region of 20 30 kg per year, but it could be larger in some years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="burkina-faso">
<h2>Burkina Faso<a class="headerlink" href="#burkina-faso" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Official figures include 306&nbsp;kg for artisanal mining in 2018; 150 kg in 2017; 235 kg in 2016; 302&nbsp;kg in 2015; and 208&nbsp;kg in 2014;. It is believed the actual artisanal production is likely to be higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="burma">
<h2>Burma<a class="headerlink" href="#burma" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>the figures shown in the table for 2014 to 2017 are reported and are believed to include artisanal mining.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cameroon">
<h2>Cameroon<a class="headerlink" href="#cameroon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>all gold mining is currently small scale or artisanal. Available estimates vary widely, from as low as 500 kg per year to something in the order of 1500 kg or 2000 kg per year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="central-african-republic">
<h2>Central African Republic<a class="headerlink" href="#central-african-republic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>artisanal gold mining is known to take place. No reliable estimates are available but it could be in the region of 50-80&nbsp;kg per year. The figures shown are reported and it is assumed these are artisanal but they may not be fully inclusive in every year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="columbia">
<h2>Columbia<a class="headerlink" href="#columbia" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Artisanal mining, both legal and illegal, is quite extensive within Columbia. The government is taking steps to improve the licencing of legal artisanal mining and also to crack down on illegal activities. However, it is not clear whether the reported figures for gold production include artisanally mined gold. It is also possible that illegally mined material is brought into or out of the country without being recorded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="congo">
<h2>Congo<a class="headerlink" href="#congo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>all gold mining is believed to be small scale or artisanal and it is believed there are more than 200 locations where this occurs. A nominal estimate of 150 kg per year is shown in the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="costa-rica">
<h2>Costa Rica<a class="headerlink" href="#costa-rica" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>all gold mining is currently artisanal. The figures in the table are reported by an official source.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="democratic-republic-of-congo">
<h2>Democratic Republic of Congo<a class="headerlink" href="#democratic-republic-of-congo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Artisanal mining is quite extensive, the figures shown include estimates for artisanal mining ranging from 4000 to 11000&nbsp;kg per year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equatorial-guinea">
<h2>Equatorial Guinea<a class="headerlink" href="#equatorial-guinea" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Artisanal gold mining is very likely to be taking
place but no accurate information is available. A nominal estimate of
200 kg per year is included in the table but it could be more or less
than this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ethiopia">
<h2>Ethiopia<a class="headerlink" href="#ethiopia" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>small scale and artisanal gold mining is significant, but not
all of it is illegal because some artisanal miners operate under a
formal license. A proportion of the gold mined from artisanal sources is
sold to the national bank but illicit sales to non-licensed buyers
remains widespread. National bank purchases of gold from artisanal
sources in fiscal year 2014/15 amounted to 5473 kg; in 2015/16 to 4145
kg and in 2016/17 to 1920 kg. Actual artisanal production could be
higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="france-french-guiana">
<h2>France (French Guiana)<a class="headerlink" href="#france-french-guiana" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>the table includes an estimate of 5000 kg per
year for artisanal mining which is not included in the official reported
figures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gabon">
<h2>Gabon<a class="headerlink" href="#gabon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>attempts to regulate artisanal gold mining are being undertaken
with gold from artisanal miners being purchased by a government agency
from 2013. The figures in the table include 66 kg for artisanal mining
in 2014; 55 kg in 2015; 50 kg in 2016 and 40 kg in 2017. Data for 2018
is all artisanal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ghana">
<h2>Ghana<a class="headerlink" href="#ghana" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>gold produced by artisanal mining is purchased by a state-owned
marketing organisation but official figures of the quantity vary
depending on the source. They are also reported in publications produced
by under the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). In the
table below the following figures are included for artisanal production:
47,044 kg in 2014; 32,073 kg in 2015; 35,292 kg in 2016; 45,992 kg in
2017 and 37,324 kg in 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guinea">
<h2>Guinea<a class="headerlink" href="#guinea" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>the figures in the table include reported figures for artisanal
mining. However, actual artisanal production may be higher than those
reported because it is difficult to distinguish the material derived
from artisanal mining within Guinea from that moved across the border
from Mali or other countries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ivory-coast">
<h2>Ivory Coast<a class="headerlink" href="#ivory-coast" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>efforts are being made within Ivory Coast to rationalise
artisanal mining as part of the EITI process. Reports suggest that it
varies considerably from year to year and may range between 1000 kg and
10&nbsp;000 kg per year. A conservative estimate of 2000 kg has been added to
reported industrial scale mine output in 2014, 3000 kg in 2015 and 4500
kg per year for 2016 to 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kenya">
<h2>Kenya<a class="headerlink" href="#kenya" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The reported figures shown are believed to include artisanal
mining but in reality it could be much higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="liberia">
<h2>Liberia<a class="headerlink" href="#liberia" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>official figures are believed to include both the industrial
mine and artisanal production.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="madagascar">
<h2>Madagascar<a class="headerlink" href="#madagascar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>estimates of artisanal mining are in the order of 100 kg to
3000&nbsp;kg per year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mali">
<h2>Mali<a class="headerlink" href="#mali" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>the figures include an estimate of 5000&nbsp;kg per year for artisanal
mining for 2014 and 2015 and 6000 kg per year thereafter, but it is
likely the real figure varies more than this from year to year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="panama">
<h2>Panama<a class="headerlink" href="#panama" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>artisanal mining is known to occur but no reliable estimates
are available. A nominal estimate of 100 kg per year has been included.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="papua-new-guinea">
<h2>Papua New Guinea<a class="headerlink" href="#papua-new-guinea" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Official estimates of “alluvial and small scale” mining are approximately 3500 to 4000 kg per year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rwanda">
<h2>Rwanda<a class="headerlink" href="#rwanda" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>it is believed that the reported and estimated figures are
actually gold that originated in neighbouring countries but is not
recorded in those countries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="south-sudan">
<h2>South Sudan<a class="headerlink" href="#south-sudan" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>artisanal mining is known to occur but reliable estimates
are difficult to obtain. It has been estimated as approximately 200 kg
per year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tanzania">
<h2>Tanzania<a class="headerlink" href="#tanzania" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Artisanal mining is known to occur and in 2015 and 2016 was
reported as approximately 30 kg per year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="togo">
<h2>Togo<a class="headerlink" href="#togo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>the reported figures are exports of gold which is transiting
through the country. It is believed the majority of this originates in
Burkina Faso from artisanal mining but it is not recorded within the
production figures for that country. Consequently it is recorded here
for completeness. Some artisanal mining is also believed to occur in
Togo.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="venezuela">
<h2>Venezuela<a class="headerlink" href="#venezuela" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>artisanal mining is believed to be quite extensive and
increasing. Estimates of quantities vary widely from less than 1000 kg
up to 9000 kg per year. The Central Bank aims to purchase all the
artisanally mined gold, however, actual output is believed to be larger
than the reported figures and therefore higher estimates have been used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vietnam">
<h2>Vietnam<a class="headerlink" href="#vietnam" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>artisanal mining is believed to be taking place at the site of
a former industrial mine. No information is available to indicate likely
scale.</p>
