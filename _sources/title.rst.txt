EXPLANATORY NOTES
=================

Coverage
----------

*World Mineral Production* covers the majority of economically important
mineral commodities. For each commodity constant efforts are made to
ensure that as many producing countries as possible are reported. For
some commodities, where statistics on production are not publicly
available, estimates are made. Users of this compilation are advised
that more statistical information than can be included in a publication
of this nature is held in the British Geological Survey files and is
available for consultation. Historical data (from 1913 for many
commodities) can be obtained from the predecessors to this series
entitled *World Mineral Statistics and* the *Statistical Summary of the
Mineral Industry*. Copies of these publications are available in the
World Archive section of the website: www.mineralsUK.com.

Arrangement of countries
-------------------------

Countries are ordered alphabetically in geographical groupings as
follows:

   | Europe
   | Africa
   | North and Central America, including the Caribbean
   | South America
   | Asia
   | Australasia, including the Pacific Islands

Metals
-------

Mine production of many metals is expressed in terms of metal content.
This is clearly indicated at the head of the table, adjacent to the unit
used. For aluminium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, nickel, tin and zinc,
mine production and metal production are shown in separate tables.
Unless otherwise specified, metal production statistics relate to metal
recovered from both domestic and imported materials, whether primary or
secondary, but exclude remelted material wherever possible.

World totals
-------------

For certain minerals and metals no world total is shown due to the
non-availability of certain individual country totals.

Exclusion of Warranty
-----------------------

Use by recipients of information provided by the BGS, is at the
recipients' own risk. BGS has taken care to ensure that information
provided is as free from error as is reasonably practical. In view of
the disparate sources of information at BGS's disposal, including such
material donated to BGS, that BGS accepts in good faith as being

Acknowledgements
------------------

Compilation of this volume of mineral statistics has been possible only
by obtaining information from a very large number of organisations
throughout the world, chiefly home and overseas government departments
and specialist national or international authorities concerned with
particular sectors of the minerals or metals industries. To all these
bodies the British Geological Survey expresses its grateful
acknowledgement for the information made available, whether in published
form or provided by direct correspondence. Particular acknowledgement is
made to the Mines Departments and other government agencies of many
countries whose regular statements, yearbooks and other reports are
worthy of direct consultations by readers in search of detail.

Specialist commodity organisations which have kindly allowed information
to be reproduced include the International Copper Study Group, the
International Lead and Zinc Study Group, the International Nickel Study
Group and the Barytes Association. In a few instances, information on
specific commodities has been obtained directly from company sources.
The co-operation of other members of the International Consultative
Group on Non-Ferrous Metal Statistics is also gratefully acknowledged.

Appendix 2 contains a fuller list of organisations to whom
acknowledgement is made.

Units
-----

The Statistics shown in this volume are expressed in metric units. The
following factors are given for converting to non-metric units:

| tonnes × 0.9842 = long tons
| tonnes × 1.1023 = short tons
| kilograms × 2.2046 = pounds
| kilograms × 32.1507 = troy ounces
| cubic metres × 35.3147 = cubic feet
| 1 tonne of crude petroleum equals on average 7 barrels of crude
  petroleum.
| 1 flask mercury = 34.5 kilograms
